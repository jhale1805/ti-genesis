# TI-GENESIS
A collection of the TI-BASIC programs that launched a struggling
algebra student into Software Engineering.

## History
My first lines of code were written on a TI-83 Plus calculator for my
8th grade algebra course. I had been struggling to master the quadratic
formula, but my teacher, a retired Marine, challenged me to program the
calculator to solve the quadratic formula, promising it could be used
on all future tests. Just two weeks and ten lines of code later I could
triumphantly enter the coefficients a, b, and c of a quadratic equation
into my calculator to easily get the solutions!

Interestingly, writing that program also gave me the confidence and the
skills to help other struggling students to better understand the
quadratic formula for themselves. Indeed, through building that first
program, I had felt the power of an influential teacher and whetted an
appetite for leveraging technology to be such an influence myself.


## Contents
I wrote many programs on my calculator throughout High School. Though
some of those programs have been lost due to RAM resets as a result of
exam requirements or dead batteries, many survived. This repository
exists to preserve this important piece of the historical record of my
journey into Software Engineering.


## Contributing
For me, this particular repository is historical and sentimental, so I
probably won't be accepting any PRs into it. That said, I do want to
document the tools you can use to more easily develop programs for the
TI series of calculators.

**TokenIDE**: A great IDE to use for programming the TI series of
calculators.

<!-- Make sure to mention the TokenIDE.ini file that has to be modified so that you can export code to Wabbit for testing -->

**WabbitEmu**: A great emulator for TI calculators.

**TI Connect**: The official software program from Texas Instruments
for copying programs from your computer to your calculator and vice
versa.
